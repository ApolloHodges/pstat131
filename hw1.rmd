#Question 1: 
Supervised learning uses given/inputed data in model for prediction/output.
Unsupervised learning works without previously known data, essentially building itself up from scratch.

#Question 2: 
Regession models excel at predicting numerical values that can range while classification models are better at working with specific given values.

#Question 3: 
Reg: SSR and Coefficients
Class: Accuaracy and Error Rate

#Question 4: 
Descriptive: Describes events/data and their relation to others.
          
Inferential: Makes inferences based on past events/data.
           
Predictive: Predicts future events/data gased on already data through patterns.

#Question 5: 
Mechanistic models use theory to predict events/outcomes while empirically-driven use previous                        events/outcomes to predict theory. They're similar in that they connect reality with theory, but                      different in the manner in which they do it.

Empirically-driven models can often be easier to understand, as they start with already confirmed data                before creating theoretical data.

The bias-variance trade-off is related to mechanistic and empirically-driven as both describe the                     ups-and-downs of taking various approaches when working with data.

#Question 6:

#Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?
This is predictive, as you are making a prediction based on prior data.

#How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?
This is inferential, as you are making an inference based on whether a prior event occured.

#Problem 1:
hist(mpg$hwy, xlab="Highway", main="MPG on Highway")

Most cars average around 20-30 MPG on the highway, left leaning.

#Problem 2:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cty)) + geom_point()

There is a strong correlation to cars MPG on the highway compared to in the city.

#Problem 3:
mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  arrange(manufacturer)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(y=manufacturer)) + geom_bar()

Dodge produced the most cars, while lincoln produced the least.

#Problem 4:
mpg %>%
  group_by(cyl)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=hwy)) + geom_boxplot()

#Problem 5:
mpg2 <- select(mpg, .data$displ, .data$year, .data$cyl, .data$cty, .data$hwy)

M = cor(mpg2)
corrplot(M, method = 'number')
