Pokemon: The name of each Pokemon.

Level: Each Pokemon's level. Levels are used as a tool to balance each Pokemon's power.

Ability, Item, and Moves: These factors contain the possible abilities, items, and moves each Pokemon can have. 
However, due to the nature of these factors (very unique and different from each other), I decided not to use it in predicting win rate.

WinRate: The win rate of a Pokemon when in a game. This is the factor we will attempting to predict.

Type1 and Type2: The typing of each Pokemon. A key thing to note is that some Pokemon only have one type.

Speed,HP,Attack,Defense,SpAtk, and SpDef: These are the stats of each Pokemon. 

-Speed determines which Pokemon goes first.
-Attack and SpAtk help determine how much damage a Physical or Special move will do respectively.
-Defense and SpDef help determine how much damage a Pokemon will resist from a Physical or Special move respectively.
-HP determines the starting Hit Points of a Pokemon. In battle, a Pokemon faints when it's HP is reduced to 0.
